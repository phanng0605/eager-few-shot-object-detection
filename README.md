# **Eager Few-Shot Object Detection with RetinaNet**

This repository provides a demonstration of fine-tuning a RetinaNet architecture, compatible with TensorFlow 2 (TF2), for eager mode object detection. The focus is on training the model on a novel class with very few examples, starting from a pre-trained COCO checkpoint.

Estimated time to run through this Colab (with GPU): < 5 minutes.
